Readme:

The write-up is probably the best thing to look at, see meteorite.pdf for that. 
The portfolio can be found in the folder labelled Portfolio.

If you want to recompile the markdown, you'll need the following libraries:
library(stringr)
library(beepr)
library(knitr)
library(BayesianFirstAid)
library(boot)
library(sandwich)
library(e1071)
all can be installed via the usuall install.packages, except for the BayesianFirstAid package, which needs to installed with the GitHub Devtools.
See instructions on how to do this on the BayesianFirstAid website:
https://github.com/rasmusab/bayesian_first_aid

This was all compiled using R-studio version 0.98 on a machine running Windows 7. 

Data availability and everything else are included in the markdown.
